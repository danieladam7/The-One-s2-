The One s2 - a simple smartwatch

JAVA OOP

Design pattern
- constructional : singleton with polymorphism
- behavioral     : state pattern

Class : The One s2 is the singleton
Class : ModeBase is superclass with successors for each mode
        Button A is same for all modes therefore implemented in superclass
        Buttons B and C are different therefore implemented by each mode differently (polymorphism)

Class: AlarmClock is helper class for mode Hour
Class: Stopwatch is helper class for mode Stopwatch
